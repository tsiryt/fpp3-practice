## Une sÃ©rie contre une autre
```r

## Trend and seasonality in ACF plots
When data have a trend, the autocorrelations for small lags tend to be large and positive because observations nearby in time are also nearby in value. So the ACF of a trended time series tends to have positive values that slowly decrease as the lags increase.

When data are seasonal, the autocorrelations will be larger for the seasonal lags (at multiples of the seasonal period) than for other lags.
```r
recent_production |>
  ACF(Beer) |>
  autoplot() + labs(title="Australian beer production")
```

## Bruit blanc
For white noise series, we expect each autocorrelation to be close to zero. Of course, they will not be exactly equal to zero as there is some random variation. For a white noise series, we expect 95% of the spikes in the ACF to lie within
$$
\pm 2 \sqrt{T}
$$
where $T$
is the length of the time series. It is common to plot these bounds on a graph of the ACF (the blue dashed lines above). If one or more large spikes are outside these bounds, or if substantially more than 5% of spikes are outside these bounds, then the series is probably not white noise.

```r
set.seed(30)
y <- tsibble(sample = 1:50, wn = rnorm(50), index = sample)
y |> autoplot(wn) + labs(title = "White noise", y = "")
y |>
  ACF(wn) |>
  autoplot() + labs(title = "White noise")
```
